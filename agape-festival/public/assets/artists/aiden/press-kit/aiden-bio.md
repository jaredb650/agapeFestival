From New York to Berlin via Milan, British-American Aiden is part of a new generation of 
artists blurring the lines between past, present, and future. Her fierce productions blend 
sounds of industrial, hardcore, and schranz — the result of her exposure to the frenetic 
world of US dance music culture combined with the rich musical legacy of her UK roots, 
already earning her a seat at the table of Kobosil's mighty 44 Label Group.
