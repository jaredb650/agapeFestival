Clara Cuvé does not relinquish pace nor energy. Her roots go back to classical piano in which she was trained since the age of
four. Claras deep love of music naturally lead her to begin accumulating a record collection throughout the years, which she
deploys during her energetic sets ranging from fast and groovy Techno to Breakbeat, Jungle and Hardcore, always focusing on
groove and dynamics.

After becoming part of the Munich label Stock5 and their monthly event series at Rote Sonne, she made her way to Berlin where
she became a resident at the infamous event series Mess that takes place at OHM and started touring all over the world. In 2020
she released her debut track “Control“ on R-Label Groups first compilation “Sektion 1“, a hard pounding Techno banger with a
haunting voice and mesmerizing synth line. Since then she has been DJing at clubs and festivals across the globe with regular
appearances at Awakenings, Melt!, Blackworks, EXHALE, Pollerwiesen and Teletech to name a few.
