David Löhlein is rewriting the rules of electronic music with his sensual dance sound - a heavy fusion of house, techno, trance and latin. Hailed for standout performances at Boiler Room: Copenhagen 2025 and HÖR On Tour Stuttgart, Löhlein balances intimacy and intensity in every set.

Through Snake Selection, his self-curated live stream platform, he stages unforgettable performances in striking locations like Chinatown, New York, and even a boxing ring, transforming DJ sets into art installations. His label Vision Ekstase extends this vision, merging music, visual art, and fashion into a holistic aesthetic.

With past collaborations on labels like Diynamic, Boys Noize Records, and Mama Told Ya, Löhlein now looks toward 2025 with Amante —- his new imprint that promises to blur the lines between sound, style, and rebellion, and set the stage for his boldest chapter yet.
