Child of the 90s, Fenrick embodies an artistic synthesis influenced by a sonic diversity ranging from the UK garage scene to 90s trance, traversing through bouncy techno and hardhouse. Immersed from a young age in the vibrancy of the electro scene, Fenrick absorbed a multitude of musical influences that now resonate in his productions and performances.

At just 25, he's making his mark on the techno scene, performing in Europe on major stages and around the world, most recently with his tours in Canada and Australia.

Passionate producer, his tracks such as "Push", "Feel The Bass" or "Mayday" have been played by the big names in places like Awakenings, Verknipt and BlackWorks. Amélie Lens, Shlømo, 999999999, Trym, Kobosil, Regal or Sara Landry already support his talented work.
Lately he's been able to offer tracks such as « Scotland Jus » and « Rockin the house », more bouncy techno oriented, which have also been hailed by many artists.

Consistently delivering quality productions, Fenrick brings a diverse sonic contribution by releasing EPs and compilations for labels such as Taapion, NineTimesNine and recently on Vermillion Trax. 
Promising DJ, Fenrick has just started to write his story and has not finished to surprise you.
