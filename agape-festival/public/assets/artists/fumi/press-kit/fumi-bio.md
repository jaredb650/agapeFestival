American-born, Berlin-based artist fumi is rapidly emerging as
one of the most exciting new voices in the techno scene. Under
the guise of her grandmother’s name, fumi’s eclectic selection
and musical background bellows a playful rendition of old and
new school techno, and comes together through quick, high
energy mixing.

As a member of 240 KM/H, fumi is not only influenced by the
techno scene, but draws ideas from many other genres and
bubbles, including jazz, hip hop, and RnB. With a dedication to
the craft of track selection and mixing, the artist treats her
setup as an instrument, composing a new sound through
layering. Characterized by fast mixing and multi-deck
construction, fumi’s sound is one of it’s own.
