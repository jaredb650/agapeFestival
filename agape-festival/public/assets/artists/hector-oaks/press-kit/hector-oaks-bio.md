Héctor Oaks is a multifaceted DJ known for his characteristic vinyl-only gigs and fiery unpredictability. His
hypnotic ghetto-tech, acid scorchers, technopunk and gritty post-industrial tracks have ignited dancefloors
from Bassiani to Miami - his “Fuego” detonates like a hand-grenade into the core of dancefloors
awakening the spirit of raves.

Born in the Spanish rave culture during the 90’s and influenced by his vinyl treasures unearthed in record
stores all over the world, his performances melt at the speed of light, and with assurance and nerve, a
mixture of Wave, Body Music, Proto-Techno, Bacalao and Berlin’s Techno.
