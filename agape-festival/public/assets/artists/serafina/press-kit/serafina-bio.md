Serafina discovered her love for music early on and quickly realized
its power to move people. In 2023, she began DJing in Hamburg,
captivating crowds with her unique blend of Techno and her warm,
open energy. She started with a heavy, Industrial sound, known for its
thumping basslines, and later embraced the faster, melodic rhythms
of 240 sound. Playing both styles with passion, Serafina thrives on
the contrast, constantly finding new inspiration. For her, every set is
about connecting with the crowd and creating unforgettable
experiences
