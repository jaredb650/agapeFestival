Supergloss has quickly conquered the modern electronic music scene with her sincere and melodic sound. Inspired
by the acid and trance of the 90s and 00s, Supergloss not only borrows key elements of the rave sound but also
reinterprets them, giving them a fresh look and a modern sensibility. Her music combines sensuality and drama
expressed in pads and leads with the fighting character of the 303 acid synth, which completely reflects her
persona - strong, but gentle.
